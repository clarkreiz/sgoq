# Description:

The core of the system consists of four main components:

- **Queue** – a simple asynchronous queue based on buffered channels and atomics. The queue is aware of tasks and their priorities, and it retrieves tasks based on priority.

- **Worker** – a simple worker, whose task is to constantly fetch tasks from the **queue** and execute them. He gets sad when he fetches an empty task. He only knows about **Dequeue** and **IsStopped**.

- **WorkerPool** – A tool for managing workers, it can increase or decrease the number of workers by a delta. It knows about the queue no more than the worker.

- **Supervisor** – the overseer of everything, who knows how many tasks are currently being worked on in the queue and can manage the number of workers via the **WorkerPool**. It contains mysterious logic for managing workers based on thresholds.
